Yet another newbie repository

I doubt anyone is going to read this.

But just in case - I'm a cow doctor procrastinating on her research project. 
Cows are very different to computers. 
Both have their merits.
Computers are clean and fast and interesting.
Cows are warm and friendly and have funny personalities.
I like both of them!
